My photographic practices varies from still life, documentary and 35mm film, however the one practice that I find myself shooting time and time again is still life.

At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution.

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

///

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
