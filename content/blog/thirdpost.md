## Code

### Styled (with Syntax)

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```

### Unstyled

User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

```
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
